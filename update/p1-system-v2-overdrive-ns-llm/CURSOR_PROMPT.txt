Generate a new repository skeleton named `p1-system-v2-overdrive-ns-llm` with the following structure and explanations.
This is an upgrade from `p1-overdrive-ns` (v1). The v2 introduces **LLM reasoning, learner/trainer modules, FinGPT/FinRL integration, and extended feature encoding**.
Please include placeholders, clear module comments, and TODO markers for future development.

[Structure & Files same as repository skeleton in this package]
- See the `docs/README_v2.md` for key motivations, cautions, and TODO.
- Emphasize: LLM only arbitrates borderline decisions; hard risk is enforced by Conformal, Hazard Exit, and Liq-Buffer gates.
- Emphasize: xLSTM replaces LSTM due to better long-range memory and lower latency vs attention models.
- Emphasize: Store both Likert-7 discrete direction and continuous dir_score for training + gates.

Deliverables:
1) Create the directories and placeholder modules listed.
2) Insert TODOs and docstrings so engineers know how to implement each part.
3) Ensure code style is Pythonic and modular, ready for ONNX or Torch inference backends.
